Overview
This project aims to predict breast cancer diagnosis using machine learning techniques based on clinical data. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify the presence of breast cancer using various diagnostic features.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains clinical features of patients and their corresponding diagnosis. Each row represents a patient, with features extracted from breast mass tissue, such as radius, texture, perimeter, and more. The target variable indicates whether the diagnosis is benign or malignant.

Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and analyze the data to understand its distribution and relationships between features.
Data Preprocessing: Clean, normalize, and transform the data to prepare it for modeling.
Model Training: Use various machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines to train predictive models.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model performance using grid search or other hyperparameter tuning techniques.
